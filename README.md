# Coolpression-Sock-Bioinnovation

The Coolpression Sock is a device which combines cooling and compression to relieve pain and inflammation caused by gout. It utilizes compression fabric to compress the swollen area and uses a Peltier tile to cool the copper straps that connect to the sock. The thermal conductive copper then transfers the cooling throughout the sock and to the targeted gout area in order to minimize pain and swelling. The product uses Arduino and Bluetooth to turn the Coolpression Sock station ON and OFF. It can be connected to an Android smartphone using Bluetooth and the Ardudroid application by TechBitar. The concept of the Coolpression Sock will succeed in relieving gout symptoms because the function of the sock fits both of the external solutions for the given symptoms. Compression is known to reduce swelling, and cooling reduces both the pain and helps reduce the inflammation. It will be used as therapy that will help relieve the user of the symptoms. It is ideal for people who are lacking medical coverage and time.
